This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Mock API for Development

This project includes a mock API system for local development. To use mock data instead of real API calls:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add the following line to enable mock API:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true
   ```
3. Remove the line or set it to `false` to use the real Open Brewery DB API

The mock API includes realistic brewery data and simulates network delays for a more authentic development experience.
